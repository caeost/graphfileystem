# graphfileystem

Made this for fun one night, basically it attempts to compress a filesystem (or really any set of [name -> io.Reader]s) into a Trie.

The operations are all meant to be relatively fast and it should hopefully compress some sets of files (although not all as the pigeon hole principle tells us).

Just a basic file system!
